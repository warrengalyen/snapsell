## Component Primitive List

Finished components are listed here. If you do not find a component you are looking for and wish to create one. Add the component name you will be developing to the list, just add your name to the end of it (i.e. large-button —JaneP). When you finish a component just remove your name from the end. This will help prevent simultaneous creations of similar or same components. If you find someone developing a component you may contact them to see if their component will work for you or collaborate on one that may fit both your needs.

SnapSell is using Shadcn for component Primitives, be sure to install: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/primitives/alert-dialog
